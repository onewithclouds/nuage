It is an artistic exploration of space that is a creative inquiry into the elegance of spatial geometry. This inquiry is skilfully embodied in exceptionally aesthetic acrylic-wood hybrid. As such, it manifests a fluent connection between the worlds of physical-tangible and ethereal-creative. This unique ring has a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Hybrid wood is a uniquely aesthetic, modern material that builds upon reclaiming highly figured, fragile and incomplete wood. Through a process of stabilization, a vacuum is used to remove all the air from the wood, replacing it with heat activated polymer resin. Once completely infused with the stabilizing solution the wood-acrylic blocks are cast and heat cured, creating a polymer backbone in otherwise fragile pieces. Upon penetration acrylic resin colors the wood, while usually contrasting with it. The polymer resin is also often used to emphasize beautiful grain of the stabilized wood. The resulting wood-acrylic hybrids are extremely durable and will neither exhibit further color shifts, nor absorb any moisture.</p>
<p>The process of creating hybrid wood relies heavily on reclaiming, up-cycling and saving fragile or otherwise unusable wood. The properties of resulting wood-acrylic hybrid resemble that of a dense hardwood, serving as durable and stunning basis for show-stopping pieces. These pieces are developed with traditional woodworking techniques through cutting, shaping and sanding.</p>
<h4>About WooDoo</h4>

WooDoo&#8217;s quest is an inquiry into the possibilities of tangible expression of this visionary aesthetic.
