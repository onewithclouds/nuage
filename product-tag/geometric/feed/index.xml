				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This ring by WooDoo is an incredible piece of contemporary jewelry crafted from extremely rare, and valuable wood. It is an artistic exploration of space that is a creative inquiry into the elegance of spatial geometry. This metaphysical inquiry is skilfully embodied in tactile and precious Purpleheart wood. As such, it manifests a fluent connection between the worlds of physical-tangible and ethereal-creative. This unique ring has a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Purpleheart is a unique precious wood that originates from the Pacific Coast of Panama and Costa Rica, as well as Atlantic Coast of Colombia. Growing up to 50m in height Purpleheart trees produce a hard and durable wood that is nevertheless notoriously difficult to work with. This difficulty stems from the wood&#8217;s tendency to release a gummy resin, when heated with dull tools or if cutter speeds are too high. The heartwood of Purpleheart is dull brown upon cutting, transforming to a shade of purple upon exposure to UV light. With aging and further exposure to UV, the Purpleheart wood will gradually shift color to dark brown with a touch of its signature purple. This transformation can be slowed by applying a UV inhibiting coating.</p>
<p>Being quite dense, purple heart is also water-resistant. This wood is very durable, and is not susceptible to decay or most of the insect attacks. The grain of this wood is mostly straight but can be wavy or irregular, while the texture is medium and exhibits a great natural luster. As to this wood&#8217;s metaphysical properties, it is believed that it can enhance creativity, facilitate acquisition of new knowledge, as well as healing and good health.</p>
