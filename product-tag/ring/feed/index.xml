				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This ring by WooDoo is an incredible piece of contemporary jewelry crafted from extremely rare, and valuable wood. It is an artistic exploration of space that is a creative inquiry into the elegance of spatial geometry. This metaphysical inquiry is skilfully embodied in tactile and precious African Blackwood. As such, it manifests a fluent connection between the worlds of physical-tangible and ethereal-creative. This unique ring has a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>African Blackwood is a very rare and expensive wood, exhibiting moisture repellent qualities, as well as incredible dimensional stability. This precious wood is highly valued since the ancient times, when its primary usage purposes included furniture and musical instruments. Considered the original ebony thousand of years ago, this wood was imported to and processed in Ancient Egypt. The name &#8220;ebony&#8217; is actually derived from Egyptian &#8220;hbny&#8221;, while other names for this wood include babanus, grenadilla and mpingo. The African Blackwood tree itself takes about 60 years to mature and originates from seasonally dry regions of Senegal, as well as similar regions east to Eritrea and south to Transvaal.</p>
<p>African Blackwood is a lustrous wood that is one of the hardest and densest in the world.  The color hue of African Blackwood ranges from reddish dark brown and purple to pure black. This timber exhibits little or no straight grain and has an even texture. Extremely durable in terms of resistance to decay, African Blackwood is also moderately resistant to insect attacks. While beautiful and durable, this precious wood is notorious for its blunting effect on wood cutters, making it very difficult to work with either by hand or with machine tools. Although pretty much indiscernible upon completion, African Blackwood has a mild distinctive scent that it emits while being processed. Among many precious woods, African Blackwood is considered one of the very finest timbers to be used in producing turned wood objects.</p>
<h4>About WooDoo</h4>
<p>WooDoo is an extraordinary, magnetic, and minimalist jewelry brand. WooDoo is about creative exploration of space and its geometric properties. WooDoo&#8217;s quest is an inquiry into the possibilities of tangible expression of this visionary aesthetic. This brand&#8217;s jewelry transcends the realm of physical, bridging the tangible and the creative.</p>
<p>WooDoo pieces are majestic and truly memorable, while being handcrafted from a number of select precious woods, including African Blackwood, Bog Oak or Purpleheart Wood. Each of the brand&#8217;s pieces is an original and unique experience of jewelry aesthetic. It is this aesthetic, along with skillful execution that WooDoo&#8217;s accessories owe to the duo of creative designers standing behind this visionary brand.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This deer antler ring is created to showcase the beauty and finesse of a natural material historically used in jewelry-making for tens of thousands of years. Polished deer antlers boast a great palette of original color shades, complemented by an authentic texture and a unique tactile feel that seems different, but somehow familiar at the same time. An original idea for a rustic designer ring, this accessory may  be considered a tribute to some of the earliest man-made jewelry, as well as poetic, yet raw beauty of nature. Being larger in size, the ring stands out with a flare of natural colors and unique tactile feel, as well as a unique patch of unpolished antler texture on the upper of the ring.</p>

<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Antlers are extensions of the skull, seasonally grown and shed by members of the deer family. Antlers are true bone that grows symmetrically in pairs and are mostly attributable to males. The growth of these unique structures places a considerable nutritional strain on the body of a deer. The size of antlers speaks of a deer&#8217;s ability to navigate and find enough food in its environment. Since the prehistoric times antlers were used to make tools, weapons and jewelry. Some antlers have unique properties, as is the case with moose antlers that greatly aid a moose&#8217;s hearing. Antlers are well known for their use by Magdalenian culture in European Late Paleolithic. From this culture, modern museums inherited a number of beautifully carved and engraved pieces of prehistoric art, including this &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison_Licking_Insect_Bite" target="_blank">Bison Licking Insect Bite</a>&#8216; spear-thrower fragment created sometime between 10,000 &#8211; 18,000 BC.</p>
