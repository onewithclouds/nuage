		<description><![CDATA[<p>This elegant pressed flower pendant containing a rose petal is created in Tiffany glass working technique. The beautiful pendant is quite romantic and feminine. It will look best on a white or white-ish background, such as a shirt or a blouse. These accessories can become absolutely essential additions to your summer boho-style outfit. But boho is not the only style to benefit from the sensual pressed flower jewelry aesthetic. Without a doubt, these accessories could also be used to lighten up the mood of a little bit more reserved, casual outfits.</p>
<p>Tereza Varga pressed flower jewelry does not require special care, but we advise to refrain from prolonged exposure to sunlight. UV light could alter the color of the glass-contained herbarium composition. You might also want to remove the pendant before taking a shower or a bath. Should your glass accessory need cleaning, feel free to wipe it with a soft cloth.</p>
