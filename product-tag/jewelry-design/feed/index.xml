<p>Mother of Pearl (Nacre) has been used in jewelry for thousands of years, with the earliest known pieces attributable to ancient Egyptians and Sumerians. East Asian and Islamic art has also used nacre for beautiful inlay work. Mother of Pearl has become extremely popular in Europe during the Victorian Era. This organic gemstone belongs to a small group that includes coral, amber, jet, ivory and, of course, pearl. Mother of Pearl is often thought of as encouraging prosperity, offering motherly and soothing protection, while promoting intuition and imagination.</p>
<p>Howlite is considered to be a stone of calm and tranquility. A stone that can calm and soothe the emotions, help cope with an overactive mind and achieve a deep and restful sleep. Howlite is believed to reduce conflicts, facilitate communication, promote kindness, compassion and peaceful coexistence.  This truly beautiful and tranquil gem is believed to aid in clarifying one’s mind to develop a more prominent awareness of ambitions and goals. Often referred to as an ‘attunement stone’, Howlite is thought to help expand the horizons and open the mind to wisdom and new knowledge.</p>
