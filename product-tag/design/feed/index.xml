		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>An ellegant branch is a poetic ode to spring, purity and vitality...</em></p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. When it comes to interpreting the symbolism of a branch, one of the most common is a reference to an olive branch. An olive branch is a notable symbol of peace, purity and good will. The symbol originates from the Arab folk transition, but is most notable in the customs of Ancient Greece. An olive branch is, in fact, present in almost every culture of the Mediterranean basin. In Ancient Greece, olive branches and wreaths were often worn by brides. A dove carrying an olive branch is a prominent symbol of peace in early Christian art. As such, an olive branch has firmly established itself as a widely recognized symbol by the XVIII century.</p>
<p>Dimensions : 36 x 10 x 0.4 mm<br />
Adjustable chain : 40-46 cm<br />
Material : Stainless Steel<br />
Color : Black</p>

<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. When it comes to interpreting the symbolism of a branch, one of the most common is a reference to an olive branch. An olive branch is a notable symbol of peace, purity and good will.

<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>
<p>The meaningful design concepts behind the visionary contemporary accessories brand Moorigin can be interpreted as inspired by nature, simple and sensual. Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design. Inspired by our planet&#8217;s living environment, the brand embraces some of nature&#8217;s most intricate and enduring forces, such as evolution and structured, orderly chaos. Stemming from a personal vision, unobstructed and uncluttered, Moorigin accessories feel personal, evoking a feeling of atmosphere and sensuality.</p>

Crystals have always been associated with spirituality. As such they were often assigned magical attributes and healing power.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Translucent body of a thin bamboo is gracefully standing between Heaven and Earth. A light fragrance is carried with the wind, creating a gentle disturbance...</em></p>
<p>Sasa is a word of Japanese origin (【笹】, ささ), denoting beautiful ground-cover bamboo that grows to about 1m in height. A distinct feature of Sasa bamboo is the fact that each of its tender branches will develop only one gracious leaf. Sasa leaves are the inspiration behind the design of this beautiful accessory. Also, Sasa will flower only once in 20 years.</p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. As such, leaves symbolize hope, revival and renewal, representing potency and growth. According to the Chinese tradition, leaves also stand for all of the beings in the universe, hence can be seen as exemplifying people.</p>
<p>Dimensions : 8 x 31 x 0.3 mm<br />
Adjustable chain : 40 - 46 cm<br />
Material : Stainless Steel<br />
Color : Silver</p>

A distinct feature of Sasa bamboo is the fact that each of its tender branches will develop only one gracious leaf. Sasa leaves are the inspiration behind the design of this beautiful accessory.

<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. As such, leaves symbolize hope, revival and renewal, representing potency and growth. According to the Chinese tradition, leaves also stand for all of the beings in the universe, hence can be seen as exemplifying people.</p>
<p>Bamboo is a symbol of regeneration, renewal, freedom of spirit and flexibility. It is also the fastest vertically growing plant on the planet with an ability to reach full height in one season. Bamboo&#8217;s growth, although remarkable, is always gradual and incremental and is reminiscent of personal continuous improvement and commitment to learning.  Also, bamboo plants might not always look to be as tough as other trees in the forest. Yet, they endure the coldest of winters, hot summers and usually are the only ones standing in the aftermath of a storm. As such, bamboo sends a powerful message that can be summarized in the common wisdom of &#8216;bend, but do not break&#8217;. A message that speaks of a more sophisticated, gentle strength. A strength that does not fight the circumstances, but through flexibility remains standing tall.</p>
<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>
<p>The meaningful design concepts behind the visionary contemporary accessories brand Moorigin can be interpreted as inspired by nature, simple and sensual. Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design. Inspired by our planet&#8217;s living environment, the brand embraces some of nature&#8217;s most intricate and enduring forces, such as evolution and structured, orderly chaos. Stemming from a personal vision, unobstructed and uncluttered, Moorigin accessories feel personal, evoking a feeling of atmosphere and sensuality.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This absolutely fabulous bracelet is inspired by the notion of protection and armor. The unrivaled design of this bracelet owes much to designer's bold and authentic creative vision, as well as impeccable and flawless execution. This bracelet is aptly created in monochrome on the premise of minimal design and outstanding selection of materials. The latter seems to give prominence to this bracelet's original composition through hematite beads that encircle and accentuate the bracelet's most refined and interesting detail - a genuine crystal of Quartz.</p>
<p>Materials: Hematite, Quartz, Metal Elements, Sterling Silver Logo Charm. Length - 19.5 cm (7.67").</p>

<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Quartz Crystals or Rock Crystals are one of the most beautiful and yet most common types of crystal found on the planet. While often referred to as &#8216;clear quartz&#8217;, the crystals can actually range from clear to cloudy to almost completely opaque. The configurations and shapes they occur in are also numerous. Quartz is one of the most universal crystals that is often believed to be able to amplify feelings, emotions, thoughts and positive affirmations. It is also used to enhance the effects of other crystals and minerals it is used with.</p>
<p>Hematite is one of the prettiest and most unique crystals used in jewelry accessories. This crystal provides a unique combination of shiny charisma, while retaining the ability to remain reserved. It is one of the few magnetic crystals the structure of which is dominated by iron. Hematite is often referred to as a ‘seeker crystal’ that helps one find a new path or approach to gain something you desire, but not yet posses. Hematite crystals are thought to have great grounding and balancing effect, as well as serving to stimulate mind, memory, sometimes evoking deep thought.</p>
<p>Materials: Hematite, Quartz, Metal Elements, Sterling Silver Logo Charm. Medium length &#8211; 19.5 cm.</p>
