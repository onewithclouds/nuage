		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Fleeting bubbles invite one to appreciate the beauty of the present moment...</em></p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. Bubbles are such an incredible symbol with their meaning spanning notions from childish and cheerful to philosophical and spiritual. A metaphor for life, delicate bubbles taking shape can mean something magical, fleeting and fragile. Every time a bubble breaks, we strive to create a new, larger and longer lasting one. It is this determination that we should also apply to our dreams and life goals. Bubbles provide rare moments of magic, letting us realize that we have the power to create and improve upon our creations. Their existence reminds us to appreciate the beauty and grace of the present moment. Bubbles also symbolize childhood innocence and fun, possibly giving us a chance to lose some of our cares and worries for moment. Let the symbolism of the bubbles inspire you to develop a prominent appreciation of life and live it to the fullest!</p>
<p>Dimensions : 15x16x0.4mm<br />
Ear Pin : 13mm<br />
Material : Stainless Steel<br />
Color : Silver</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fleeting bubbles invite one to appreciate the beauty of the present moment&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. Bubbles are such an incredible symbol with their meaning spanning notions from childish and cheerful to philosophical and spiritual. A metaphor for life, delicate bubbles taking shape can mean something magical, fleeting and fragile. Every time a bubble breaks, we strive to create a new, larger and longer lasting one. It is this determination that we should also apply to our dreams and life goals. Bubbles provide rare moments of magic, letting us realize that we have the power to create and improve upon our creations. Their existence reminds us to appreciate the beauty and grace of the present moment. Bubbles also symbolize childhood innocence and fun, possibly giving us a chance to lose some of our cares and worries for moment. Let the symbolism of the bubbles inspire you to develop a prominent appreciation of life and live it to the fullest!</p>
<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>
<p>The meaningful design concepts behind the visionary contemporary accessories brand Moorigin can be interpreted as inspired by nature, simple and sensual. Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design. Inspired by our planet&#8217;s living environment, the brand embraces some of nature&#8217;s most intricate and enduring forces, such as evolution and structured, orderly chaos. Stemming from a personal vision, unobstructed and uncluttered, Moorigin accessories feel personal, evoking a feeling of atmosphere and sensuality.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This elegant pressed flower pendant containing a rose petal is created in Tiffany glass working technique. The beautiful pendant is quite romantic and feminine. It will look best on a white or white-ish background, such as a shirt or a blouse. These accessories can become absolutely essential additions to your summer boho-style outfit. But boho is not the only style to benefit from the sensual pressed flower jewelry aesthetic. Without a doubt, these accessories could also be used to lighten up the mood of a little bit more reserved, casual outfits.</p>
<p>Tereza Varga pressed flower jewelry does not require special care, but we advise to refrain from prolonged exposure to sunlight. UV light could alter the color of the glass-contained herbarium composition. You might also want to remove the pendant before taking a shower or a bath. Should your glass accessory need cleaning, feel free to wipe it with a soft cloth.</p>
