<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Hematite is one of the prettiest and most unique crystals used in jewelry accessories. This crystal provides a unique combination of shiny charisma, while retaining the ability to remain reserved. It is one of the few magnetic crystals the structure of which is dominated by iron. Hematite is often referred to as a &#8216;seeker crystal&#8217; that helps one find a new path or approach to gain something you desire, but not yet posses. Hematite crystals are thought to have great grounding and balancing effect, as well as serving to stimulate mind, memory, sometimes evoking deep thought.</p>
<p>Since the ancient times, Howlite is considered to be a stone of calm and tranquility. A stone that can calm and soothe the emotions, help cope with an overactive mind and achieve a deep and restful sleep. Howlite is believed to reduce conflicts, facilitate communication, promote kindness, compassion and peaceful coexistence.  This truly beautiful and tranquil gem is believed to aid in clarifying one&#8217;s mind to develop a more prominent awareness of one&#8217;s ambitions and goals. Often referred to as an &#8216;attunement stone&#8217;, Howlite is thought to help expand the horizons and open the mind to wisdom and new knowledge.</p>
