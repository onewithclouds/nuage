<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. The ripple effect may often be referred to as a heartbeat to eternity. The symbolism behind it is often based around the understanding that we are all interconnected. For instance, thoughts and actions can be associated with stones dropped into a lake, creating outward traveling ripples. These ripples, in turn, affect other people's lives, while their reactions - our own. This pattern has been successfully applied to the scientific studies of computer science, economics and social interaction. The intricate message of this symbolic construct is that each of us, even if in the smallest of ways, has an innate capacity to change the world.</p>
<p>Dimensions : 18 x 60 x 0.3 mm<br />
Hook : 18 mm<br />
Material : Stainless Steel<br />
Color : Black</p>

<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. The ripple effect may often be referred to as a heartbeat to eternity. The symbolism behind it is often based around the understanding that we are all interconnected. For instance, thoughts and actions can be associated with stones dropped into a lake, creating outward traveling ripples. These ripples, in turn, affect other people&#8217;s lives, while their reactions &#8211; our own. This pattern has been successfully applied to the scientific studies of computer science, economics and social interaction. The intricate message of this symbolic construct is that each of us, even if in the smallest of ways, has an innate capacity to change the world.</p>
<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>
<p>The meaningful design concepts behind the visionary contemporary accessories brand Moorigin can be interpreted as inspired by nature, simple and sensual. Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design. Inspired by our planet&#8217;s living environment, the brand embraces some of nature&#8217;s most intricate and enduring forces, such as evolution and structured, orderly chaos. Stemming from a personal vision, unobstructed and uncluttered, Moorigin accessories feel personal, evoking a feeling of atmosphere and sensuality.</p>
