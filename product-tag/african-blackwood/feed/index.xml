				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These wonderful earrings were recreated by WooDoo on our special request in extremely rare and valuable African Blackwood. This request was made specifically to complement WooDoo&#8217;s magnificent <a href="https://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-african-blackwood-ring-w07" target="_blank">African Blackwood W07</a> and <a href="https://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-african-blackwood-ring-polyhedral-w08" target="_blank">W08</a> rings. The earrings are complete with delicate and graceful silver pins. Fluent, unique and minimalist, these earrings have a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>African Blackwood is a very rare and expensive wood, exhibiting moisture repellent qualities, as well as incredible dimensional stability. This precious wood is highly valued since the ancient times, when its primary usage purposes included furniture and musical instruments. Considered the original ebony thousand of years ago, this wood was imported to and processed in Ancient Egypt. The name &#8220;ebony&#8217; is actually derived from Egyptian &#8220;hbny&#8221;, while other names for this wood include babanus, grenadilla and mpingo. The African Blackwood tree itself takes about 60 years to mature and originates from seasonally dry regions of Senegal, as well as similar regions east to Eritrea and south to Transvaal.</p>
<p>African Blackwood is a lustrous wood that is one of the hardest and densest in the world.  The color hue of African Blackwood ranges from reddish dark brown and purple to pure black. This timber exhibits little or no straight grain and has an even texture. Extremely durable in terms of resistance to decay, African Blackwood is also moderately resistant to insect attacks. While beautiful and durable, this precious wood is notorious for its blunting effect on wood cutters, making it very difficult to work with either by hand or with machine tools. Although pretty much indiscernible upon completion, African Blackwood has a mild distinctive scent that it emits while being processed. Among many precious woods, African Blackwood is considered one of the very finest timbers to be used in producing turned wood objects.</p>
<h4>About WooDoo</h4>
<p>WooDoo is an incredibly magentic contemporary jewelry brand unlike any other. WooDoo is concerned with creative exploration of space, its geometric properties, as well as the possibilities of their tangible expression. All of this combines into a very original and unique aesthetic. WooDoo&#8217;s works are true artistic explorations of the properties of space. These explorations stem from visions of space that get translated into the physical world by means of minimalist tangible objects. But even after receiving physical form, WooDoo&#8217;s jewelry pieces feel deeply rooted in the realm of creative and visionary.</p>
<p>WooDoo&#8217;s accessories are truly memorable, commanding attention and recognition and are handcrafted from a number of select tactile precious woods, like African Blackwood or Purpleheart Wood. Each of WooDoo&#8217;s jewelry pieces carries an unmistakably modern, contemporary jewelry aesthetic. It is this aesthetic, along with skillful execution that WooDoo&#8217;s accessories owe to the duo of creative designers, standing behind this unique and visionary brand.</p>
