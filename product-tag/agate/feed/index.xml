				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among Miracle&#8217;s beautiful necklaces, this absolutely stunning piece can surely be referred to as not only authentic, atmospheric and refined, but also modern and contemporary. This necklace sees an impeccable implementation of the artist&#8217;s creative vision, as well as an incredible selection of materials, including semi-precious violet agate, brass chain accents, as well as stylish pairs of elongated blue howlite beads. The necklace is built around a large circular chain, giving it a bit of a modern choker vibe.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Agate is a magnificent  stone that is believed to have been one of humanity&#8217;s earliest possessions. According to researchers, Agate was mined in Ancient Egypt as early as 3500 B.C. As per Agate&#8217;s properties, it is regarded as providing a harmonizing influence. It is believed to help with balancing of emotional, physical and intellectual endeavors, harmonizing the Ying and Yang. A soothing and calming stone, Agate is thought to bring great strength gradually and is said to aid with the acceptances of oneself/building self confidence. It is also believed that Agate can improve concentration and analytical abilities, resulting in newfound practical solutions.</p>
<p>Howlite is considered to be a stone of calm and tranquility. A stone that can calm and soothe the emotions, help cope with an overactive mind and achieve a deep and restful sleep. Howlite is believed to reduce conflicts, facilitate communication, promote kindness, compassion and peaceful coexistence.  This truly beautiful and tranquil gem is believed to aid in clarifying one’s mind to develop a more prominent awareness of ambitions and goals. Often referred to as an ‘attunement stone’, Howlite is thought to help expand the horizons and open the mind to wisdom and new knowledge.</p>

<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Agate is a magnificent  stone that is believed to have been one of humanity&#8217;s earliest possessions. According to researchers, Agate was mined in Ancient Egypt as early as 3500 B.C. As per Agate&#8217;s properties, it is regarded as providing a harmonizing influence.

<p>Mother of Pearl (Nacre) has been used in jewelry for thousands of years, with the earliest known pieces attributable to ancient Egyptians and Sumerians. East Asian and Islamic art has also used nacre for beautiful inlay work. Mother of Pearl has become extremely popular in Europe during the Victorian Era. This organic gemstone belongs to a small group that includes coral, amber, jet, ivory and, of course, pearl. Mother of Pearl is often thought of as encouraging prosperity, offering motherly and soothing protection, while promoting intuition and imagination.</p>
<p>Howlite is considered to be a stone of calm and tranquility. A stone that can calm and soothe the emotions, help cope with an overactive mind and achieve a deep and restful sleep. Howlite is believed to reduce conflicts, facilitate communication, promote kindness, compassion and peaceful coexistence.  This truly beautiful and tranquil gem is believed to aid in clarifying one’s mind to develop a more prominent awareness of ambitions and goals.
