				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among Miracle&#8217;s beautiful necklaces, this absolutely stunning piece can surely be referred to as not only authentic, atmospheric and refined, but also modern and contemporary. This necklace sees an impeccable implementation of the artist&#8217;s creative vision, as well as an incredible selection of materials, including semi-precious violet agate, brass chain accents, as well as stylish pairs of elongated blue howlite beads. The necklace is built around a large circular chain, giving it a bit of a modern choker vibe.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Agate is a magnificent  stone that is believed to have been one of humanity&#8217;s earliest possessions. According to researchers, Agate was mined in Ancient Egypt as early as 3500 B.C. As per Agate&#8217;s properties, it is regarded as providing a harmonizing influence. It is believed to help with balancing of emotional, physical and intellectual endeavors, harmonizing the Ying and Yang. A soothing and calming stone, Agate is thought to bring great strength gradually and is said to aid with the acceptances of oneself/building self confidence. It is also believed that Agate can improve concentration and analytical abilities, resulting in newfound practical solutions.</p>
<p>Howlite is considered to be a stone of calm and tranquility. A stone that can calm and soothe the emotions, help cope with an overactive mind and achieve a deep and restful sleep. Howlite is believed to reduce conflicts, facilitate communication, promote kindness, compassion and peaceful coexistence.  This truly beautiful and tranquil gem is believed to aid in clarifying one’s mind to develop a more prominent awareness of ambitions and goals. Often referred to as an ‘attunement stone’, Howlite is thought to help expand the horizons and open the mind to wisdom and new knowledge.</p>
<h4>About Miracle</h4>

This organic gemstone belongs to a small group that includes coral, amber, jet, ivory and, of course, pearl. Mother of Pearl is often thought of as encouraging prosperity, offering motherly and soothing protection, while promoting intuition and imagination.</p>

<p>Since the ancient times coral is a traditional gift of protection for the expectant mother or a newborn child. Coral is also associated with emotional healing. Blue coral in particular is believed to have an ability of reconnecting oneself to one&#8217;s inner child, providing stability, reducing fear and finding inner peace. Coral is also believed to extend its protection to anyone living, traveling or working by/in the sea. Since coral is of organic origin, it is often thought of as an aid in rekindling one&#8217;s relationship with nature and its wonders, stimulating creativity and optimism, as well as enabling it&#8217;s bearer to enjoy life to the fullest. It may be the reason why, all around the world, coral has been used as jewelry for at least thousands of years.</p>
