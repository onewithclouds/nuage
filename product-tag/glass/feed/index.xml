		<description><![CDATA[<p>This elegant pressed flower pendant containing a rose petal is created in Tiffany glass working technique. The beautiful pendant is quite romantic and feminine. It will look best on a white or white-ish background, such as a shirt or a blouse. These accessories can become absolutely essential additions to your summer boho-style outfit. But boho is not the only style to benefit from the sensual pressed flower jewelry aesthetic. Without a doubt, these accessories could also be used to lighten up the mood of a little bit more reserved, casual outfits.</p>
<p>Tereza Varga pressed flower jewelry does not require special care, but we advise to refrain from prolonged exposure to sunlight. UV light could alter the color of the glass-contained herbarium composition. You might also want to remove the pendant before taking a shower or a bath. Should your glass accessory need cleaning, feel free to wipe it with a soft cloth.</p>

<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Lava rock, volcanic rock or basalt is a beautiful matte black stone with an incredible texture. It is believed to be an excellent grounding stone, strengthening one&#8217;s connection to Mother Earth and providing stability in the time of change. Lava rock is also often thought of as a physical embodiment of fire, being a stone that started as fiery molten lava, subsequently turning into rock.</p>
<h4>About Tsumi</h4>
<p>Tsumi is a brand born from the love of fashion, as well as an inherent need to be original and unique. Each Tsumi accessory is infused by a touch of authentic ethnic flair and is inspired by joyful memories of traveling the world. Tsumi accessories are crafted with an incredible skill, while remaining visionary and creative pieces of contemporary jewelry.</p>
<p>Most of Tsumi accessories are made in either limited quantity or in one unique specimen. Tsumi is also synonymous with an exceptional selection of original and rare materials used to create their stylish accessories. These include semi-precious stones, corals, pearls and crystals, making Tsumi jewelry not only an embodiment of original style, but also an experience.</p>
