				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This ring by WooDoo is an incredible piece of contemporary jewelry crafted from extremely rare, and valuable wood. It is an artistic exploration of space that is a creative inquiry into the elegance of spatial geometry. This metaphysical inquiry is skilfully embodied in tactile and precious African Blackwood. As such, it manifests a fluent connection between the worlds of physical-tangible and ethereal-creative. This unique ring has a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>African Blackwood is a very rare and expensive wood, exhibiting moisture repellent qualities, as well as incredible dimensional stability. This precious wood is highly valued since the ancient times, when its primary usage purposes included furniture and musical instruments. Considered the original ebony thousand of years ago, this wood was imported to and processed in Ancient Egypt. The name &#8220;ebony&#8217; is actually derived from Egyptian &#8220;hbny&#8221;, while other names for this wood include babanus, grenadilla and mpingo. The African Blackwood tree itself takes about 60 years to mature and originates from seasonally dry regions of Senegal, as well as similar regions east to Eritrea and south to Transvaal.</p>
<p>African Blackwood is a lustrous wood that is one of the hardest and densest in the world.  The color hue of African Blackwood ranges from reddish dark brown and purple to pure black. This timber exhibits little or no straight grain and has an even texture. Extremely durable in terms of resistance to decay, African Blackwood is also moderately resistant to insect attacks. While beautiful and durable, this precious wood is notorious for its blunting effect on wood cutters, making it very difficult to work with either by hand or with machine tools. Although pretty much indiscernible upon completion, African Blackwood has a mild distinctive scent that it emits while being processed. Among many precious woods, African Blackwood is considered one of the very finest timbers to be used in producing turned wood objects.</p>
<h4>About WooDoo</h4>
<p>WooDoo is an extraordinary, magnetic, and minimalist jewelry brand. WooDoo is about creative exploration of space and its geometric properties. WooDoo&#8217;s quest is an inquiry into the possibilities of tangible expression of this visionary aesthetic. This brand&#8217;s jewelry transcends the realm of physical, bridging the tangible and the creative.</p>
<p>WooDoo pieces are majestic and truly memorable, while being handcrafted from a number of select precious woods, including African Blackwood, Bog Oak or Purpleheart Wood. Each of the brand&#8217;s pieces is an original and unique experience of jewelry aesthetic. It is this aesthetic, along with skillful execution that WooDoo&#8217;s accessories owe to the duo of creative designers standing behind this visionary brand.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>These wonderful earrings were recreated by WooDoo on our special request in extremely rare and valuable African Blackwood. This request was made specifically to complement WooDoo's casual <a href="https://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-deer-antler-ring-polished-w10" target="_blank">Deer Antler W10</a> ring. The earrings are complete with delicate and graceful silver pins. Fluent, unique and minimalist, these earrings have a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<p>Engineered Stone is a material that considerably improves upon the properties of natural stone. Engineered stone was invented in Italy in early 1980s by Marcello Toncelli, founder of world-renowned Breton S.P.A. This type of stone is tailor-made with a mix of stone/marble powder, low-viscosity/high-strength epoxy or resin, a supplement of coloring, stabilizers and UV absorbing additives. To complement stone/marble powder aggregates, materials like colored glass or metal flakes can be added. Depending on the composition of stone powders and their intended application, there exist two major types of engineered stone - marble and quartz.</p>

To complement stone/marble powder aggregates, materials like colored glass or metal flakes can be added. Depending on the composition of stone powders and their intended application, there exist two major types of engineered stone &#8211; marble and quartz.</p>
<p>Engineered stone is mainly worked with a water jet cutter or a diamond blade. It is less porous, exhibiting a uniform structure without any hidden internal cracks or flaws. The binding resin allows for some flexibility, preventing engineered stone from cracking. This property decreases over time, as resins continue to harden during a product&#8217;s lifetime. It is worth noting that engineered stone is not completely UV stable, so a very long exposure to UV light might result in color changes and breakdown of the epoxy or resin binding agents.</p>

As such, it manifests a fluent connection between the worlds of physical-tangible and ethereal-creative. This unique ring has a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Purpleheart is a unique precious wood that originates from the Pacific Coast of Panama and Costa Rica, as well as Atlantic Coast of Colombia. Growing up to 50m in height Purpleheart trees produce a hard and durable wood that is nevertheless notoriously difficult to work with. This difficulty stems from the wood&#8217;s tendency to release a gummy resin, when heated with dull tools or if cutter speeds are too high. The heartwood of Purpleheart is dull brown upon cutting, transforming to a shade of purple upon exposure to UV light. With aging and further exposure to UV, the Purpleheart wood will gradually shift color to dark brown with a touch of its signature purple. This transformation can be slowed by applying a UV inhibiting coating.</p>
<p>Being quite dense, purple heart is also water-resistant. This wood is very durable, and is not susceptible to decay or most of the insect attacks. The grain of this wood is mostly straight but can be wavy or irregular, while the texture is medium and exhibits a great natural luster. As to this wood&#8217;s metaphysical properties, it is believed that it can enhance creativity, facilitate acquisition of new knowledge, as well as healing and good health.</p>
