		<description><![CDATA[<p>This deer antler ring is created to showcase the beauty and finesse of a natural material historically used in jewelry-making for tens of thousands of years. Polished deer antlers boast a great palette of original color shades, complemented by an authentic texture and a unique tactile feel that seems different, but somehow familiar at the same time. An original idea for a rustic designer ring, this accessory may  be considered a tribute to some of the earliest man-made jewelry, as well as poetic, yet raw beauty of nature. Being larger in size, the ring stands out with a flare of natural colors and unique tactile feel, as well as a unique patch of unpolished antler texture on the upper of the ring.</p>

Deer antlers boast a great palette of original color shades, complemented by an authentic texture and a unique tactile feel that seems different, but somehow familiar at the same time. An original idea for a rustic designer ring, this accessory may  be considered a tribute to some of the earliest man-made jewelry, as well as poetic, yet raw beauty of nature. Being larger in size, the ring stands out with a flare of natural colors and unique tactile feel, as well as a unique patch of unpolished antler texture on the upper of the ring.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Antlers are extensions of the skull, seasonally grown and shed by members of the deer family. Antlers are true bone that grows symmetrically in pairs and are mostly attributable to males. The growth of these unique structures places a considerable nutritional strain on the body of a deer. The size of antlers speaks of a deer&#8217;s ability to navigate and find enough food in its environment. Since the prehistoric times antlers were used to make tools, weapons and jewelry. Some antlers have unique properties, as is the case with moose antlers that greatly aid a moose&#8217;s hearing. Antlers are well known for their use by Magdalenian culture in European Late Paleolithic. From this culture, modern museums inherited a number of beautifully carved and engraved pieces of prehistoric art, including this &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison_Licking_Insect_Bite" target="_blank">Bison Licking Insect Bite</a>&#8216; spear-thrower fragment created sometime between 10,000 &#8211; 18,000 BC.</p>
<h4>About WooDoo</h4>
