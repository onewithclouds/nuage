<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. When it comes to interpreting the symbolism of a branch, one of the most common is a reference to an olive branch. An olive branch is a notable symbol of peace, purity and good will. The symbol originates from the Arab folk transition, but is most notable in the customs of Ancient Greece. An olive branch is, in fact, present in almost every culture of the Mediterranean basin. In Ancient Greece, olive branches and wreaths were often worn by brides. A dove carrying an olive branch is a prominent symbol of peace in early Christian art. As such, an olive branch has firmly established itself as a widely recognized symbol by the XVIII century.</p>

<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. When it comes to interpreting the symbolism of a branch, one of the most common is a reference to an olive branch. An olive branch is a notable symbol of peace, purity and good will. The symbol originates from the Arab folk transition, but is most notable in the customs of Ancient Greece. An olive branch is, in fact, present in almost every culture of the Mediterranean basin. In Ancient Greece, olive branches and wreaths were often worn by brides. A dove carrying an olive branch is a prominent symbol of peace in early Christian art. As such, an olive branch has firmly established itself as a widely recognized symbol by the XVIII century.</p>
<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>

Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design.
