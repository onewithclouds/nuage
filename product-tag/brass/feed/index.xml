<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Pyrite is a stunning mineral that bears incredible resemblance to gold. The fire is often sad to be hidden with its gleaming beauty. Pyrite is a stone that is brought to life by striking it against another stone or metal, producing plentiful sparks. Hence this mineral is often appearing as a stone of action vitality and will. A stone that taps into a person&#8217;s abilities and potential. This beautiful stone is believed to bring confidence and persistence to carry things to completion. A stone with a strong connection to Earth element, it closely resonates with Fire as well, providing for a symbolic connection between the two. Pyrite is often thought of as reminiscent of the warmth and lasting presence of the sun, as well as the ability to generate desirable outcomes by one&#8217;s own power.</p>
<p>Hematite is one of the prettiest and most unique crystals used in jewelry accessories. This crystal provides a unique combination of shiny charisma, while retaining the ability to remain reserved. It is one of the few magnetic crystals the structure of which is dominated by iron. Hematite is often referred to as a &#8216;seeker crystal&#8217; that helps one find a new path or approach to gain something you desire, but not yet posses. Hematite crystals are thought to have great grounding and balancing effect, as well as serving to stimulate mind, memory, sometimes evoking deep thought.</p>
<p>Lava rock, volcanic rock or basalt is a beautiful matte black stone with an incredible texture. It is believed to be an excellent grounding stone, strengthening one&#8217;s connection to Mother Earth and providing stability in the time of change. Lava rock is also often thought of as a physical embodiment of fire, being a stone that started as fiery molten lava, subsequently turning into rock.</p>
