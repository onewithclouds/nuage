<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Agate is a magnificent  stone that is believed to have been one of humanity&#8217;s earliest possessions. According to researchers, Agate was mined in Ancient Egypt as early as 3500 B.C. As per Agate&#8217;s properties, it is regarded as providing a harmonizing influence. It is believed to help with balancing of emotional, physical and intellectual endeavors, harmonizing the Ying and Yang. A soothing and calming stone, Agate is thought to bring great strength gradually and is said to aid with the acceptances of oneself/building self confidence. It is also believed that Agate can improve concentration and analytical abilities, resulting in newfound practical solutions.</p>
<p>Howlite is considered to be a stone of calm and tranquility. A stone that can calm and soothe the emotions, help cope with an overactive mind and achieve a deep and restful sleep. Howlite is believed to reduce conflicts, facilitate communication, promote kindness, compassion and peaceful coexistence.  This truly beautiful and tranquil gem is believed to aid in clarifying one’s mind to develop a more prominent awareness of ambitions and goals. Often referred to as an ‘attunement stone’, Howlite is thought to help expand the horizons and open the mind to wisdom and new knowledge.</p>

Deer antlers boast a great palette of original color shades, complemented by an authentic texture and a unique tactile feel that seems different, but somehow familiar at the same time. An original idea for a rustic designer ring, this accessory may  be considered a tribute to some of the earliest man-made jewelry, as well as poetic, yet raw beauty of nature. Being larger in size, the ring stands out with a flare of natural colors and unique tactile feel, as well as a unique patch of unpolished antler texture on the upper of the ring.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Antlers are extensions of the skull, seasonally grown and shed by members of the deer family. Antlers are true bone that grows symmetrically in pairs and are mostly attributable to males. The growth of these unique structures places a considerable nutritional strain on the body of a deer. The size of antlers speaks of a deer&#8217;s ability to navigate and find enough food in its environment. Since the prehistoric times antlers were used to make tools, weapons and jewelry. Some antlers have unique properties, as is the case with moose antlers that greatly aid a moose&#8217;s hearing. Antlers are well known for their use by Magdalenian culture in European Late Paleolithic. From this culture, modern museums inherited a number of beautifully carved and engraved pieces of prehistoric art, including this &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison_Licking_Insect_Bite" target="_blank">Bison Licking Insect Bite</a>&#8216; spear-thrower fragment created sometime between 10,000 &#8211; 18,000 BC.</p>
