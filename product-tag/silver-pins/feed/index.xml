This request was made specifically to complement WooDoo&#8217;s magnificent <a href="http://localhost/wpstatic/product/woodoo-african-blackwood-ring-w07" target="_blank">African Blackwood W07</a> and <a href="http://localhost/wpstatic/product/woodoo-african-blackwood-ring-polyhedral-w08" target="_blank">W08</a> rings. The earrings are complete with delicate and graceful silver pins. Fluent, unique and minimalist, these earrings have a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>African Blackwood is a very rare and expensive wood, exhibiting moisture repellent qualities, as well as incredible dimensional stability. This precious wood is highly valued since the ancient times, when its primary usage purposes included furniture and musical instruments. Considered the original ebony thousand of years ago, this wood was imported to and processed in Ancient Egypt. The name &#8220;ebony&#8217; is actually derived from Egyptian &#8220;hbny&#8221;, while other names for this wood include babanus, grenadilla and mpingo. The African Blackwood tree itself takes about 60 years to mature and originates from seasonally dry regions of Senegal, as well as similar regions east to Eritrea and south to Transvaal.</p>
<p>African Blackwood is a lustrous wood that is one of the hardest and densest in the world.  The color hue of African Blackwood ranges from reddish dark brown and purple to pure black. This timber exhibits little or no straight grain and has an even texture. Extremely durable in terms of resistance to decay, African Blackwood is also moderately resistant to insect attacks. While beautiful and durable, this precious wood is notorious for its blunting effect on wood cutters, making it very difficult to work with either by hand or with machine tools. Although pretty much indiscernible upon completion, African Blackwood has a mild distinctive scent that it emits while being processed. Among many precious woods, African Blackwood is considered one of the very finest timbers to be used in producing turned wood objects.</p>

This request was made specifically to complement WooDoo's casual <a href="http://localhost/wpstatic/product/woodoo-deer-antler-ring-polished-w10" target="_blank">Deer Antler W10</a> ring.

<p>Engineered Stone is a material that considerably improves upon the properties of natural stone. Engineered stone was invented in Italy in early 1980s by Marcello Toncelli, founder of world-renowned Breton S.P.A. This type of stone is tailor-made with a mix of stone/marble powder, low-viscosity/high-strength epoxy or resin, a supplement of coloring, stabilizers and UV absorbing additives. To complement stone/marble powder aggregates, materials like colored glass or metal flakes can be added. Depending on the composition of stone powders and their intended application, there exist two major types of engineered stone - marble and quartz.</p>

Depending on the composition of stone powders and their intended application, there exist two major types of engineered stone &#8211; marble and quartz.</p>
<p>Engineered stone is mainly worked with a water jet cutter or a diamond blade. It is less porous, exhibiting a uniform structure without any hidden internal cracks or flaws. The binding resin allows for some flexibility, preventing engineered stone from cracking. This property decreases over time, as resins continue to harden during a product&#8217;s lifetime. It is worth noting that engineered stone is not completely UV stable, so a very long exposure to UV light might result in color changes and breakdown of the epoxy or resin binding agents.</p>
