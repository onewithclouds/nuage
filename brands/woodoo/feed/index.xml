				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These wonderful earrings were recreated by WooDoo on our special request in extremely rare and valuable African Blackwood. This request was made specifically to complement WooDoo&#8217;s magnificent <a href="http://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-african-blackwood-ring-w07" target="_blank">African Blackwood W07</a> and <a href="http://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-african-blackwood-ring-polyhedral-w08" target="_blank">W08</a> rings. The earrings are complete with delicate and graceful silver pins. Fluent, unique and minimalist, these earrings have a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>African Blackwood is a very rare and expensive wood, exhibiting moisture repellent qualities, as well as incredible dimensional stability. This precious wood is highly valued since the ancient times, when its primary usage purposes included furniture and musical instruments. Considered the original ebony thousand of years ago, this wood was imported to and processed in Ancient Egypt. The name &#8220;ebony&#8217; is actually derived from Egyptian &#8220;hbny&#8221;, while other names for this wood include babanus, grenadilla and mpingo. The African Blackwood tree itself takes about 60 years to mature and originates from seasonally dry regions of Senegal, as well as similar regions east to Eritrea and south to Transvaal.</p>
<p>African Blackwood is a lustrous wood that is one of the hardest and densest in the world.  The color hue of African Blackwood ranges from reddish dark brown and purple to pure black. This timber exhibits little or no straight grain and has an even texture. Extremely durable in terms of resistance to decay, African Blackwood is also moderately resistant to insect attacks. While beautiful and durable, this precious wood is notorious for its blunting effect on wood cutters, making it very difficult to work with either by hand or with machine tools. Although pretty much indiscernible upon completion, African Blackwood has a mild distinctive scent that it emits while being processed. Among many precious woods, African Blackwood is considered one of the very finest timbers to be used in producing turned wood objects.</p>

		<title>WooDoo Bog Oak Bracelet with a Hidden Print W04</title>
		<link>http://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-bog-oak-leather-bracelet-stealthy-print-w04</link>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>A conceptual piece, this bracelet is made with extremely rare and valuable bog oak. The look of the centerpiece on a minimalist leather strap mimics that of a watch, except the watch-face is replaced with a print. The monochromatic print is only visible from an angle, giving this bracelet a look that is literally timeless, mysterious and elegant. The aesthetics of bog oak, which takes thousands of years to mature, hint at the endurance, change and immensity of passing time. This beautiful and monumental concept is complemented with a print reminiscent of a crystalline structure. Looking at this watch-inspired bracelet is a bit like staring into infinite and eternal space, making the question of 'what time is it?' a bit redundant. Skillfully crafted, this bracelet is a stunning contemporary piece that is minimalist, creative and unique.</p>
<p>Bog Oak is an exceptionally rare form of timber that is comparable to some of the most expensive tropical hardwoods. It is notable for high strength and magnificent beauty. Other common names of bog-wood include abanos and morta. Essentially, bog oak is oak wood in the early stages of fossilization. This type of wood cannot be produced artificially, so it can only be obtained from natural sources like peat bogs and river beds. Having been submerged in acidic, oxygen-free conditions, this type of wood takes literally hundreds, but more often thousands of years to "mature". During this time iron and minerals from the water bind with tannin in the wood, resulting in a considerably darker, golden-brown to pure black color, as well as a significantly increased hardness and density. Due to this density, bog oak can only be carved with exceptionally firm tools.</p>

Essentially, bog oak is oak wood in the early stages of fossilization. This type of wood cannot be produced artificially, so it can only be obtained from natural sources like peat bogs and river beds. Having been submerged in acidic, oxygen-free conditions, this type of wood takes literally hundreds, but more often thousands of years to &#8220;mature&#8221;. During this time iron and minerals from the water bind with tannin in the wood, resulting in a considerably darker, golden-brown to pure black color, as well as a significantly increased hardness and density. Due to this density, bog oak can only be carved with exceptionally firm tools.</p>
<p>Since supply of bog oak is so limited, prices for this type of wood are quite high. This is attributable to the fact that sites of bog oak are extremely rare and hard to access. The recovery of bog-wood trunks is often a difficult and engaging process, requiring meticulous preparation. At the same time, the much anticipated moment of extraction is the wood&#8217;s first exposure to light in hundreds and thousands of years. Extracted bog-wood is very delicate and requires complex desiccation. Nevertheless, despite great care most of the raw wood is not suitable for processing. Processing itself is notoriously unpredictable as some parts may be supple, while others very hard. All of this implies high value of raw and processed bog-oak wood.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of aesthetics, bog-oak is a genuine experience of naturally formed color. This is particularly appealing to material connoisseurs who point to exquisite permeation of wood structure by the dark and noble color. The authenticity of this wood is complemented by its texture and grain. Parts of the wood may become combined, creating variations in color, as well as direction of growth rings. This imperfect appearance often adds to the aesthetic of bog-wood, conveying a powerful message of intensity of the past times, as well as longevity of the wood and the fact of its remaining intact. It may very well be the reason why in the nineteenth century bog oak was used to make exceptionally beautiful carved decorative jewelry.</p>
<p>As to the symbolism and metaphysical properties associated with the materials used in this bracelet, oak is one of the most sacred trees that stands for the invocation of wisdom, authority, endurance, strength and protection. Oak is also believed to bring vitality and long life and is considered among the most powerful and sacred Druid woods. In Ancient Celtic culture oak was considered to be the protector. Oak wood is also used as healing wood and is believed to aid in focusing the mind on the task at hand. Oak is said to inspire bravery, presence, leadership and enduring strength.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>A conceptual piece this bracelet is made with extremely rare and valuable bog oak. The look of the centerpiece on a minimalist leather strap mimics that of a watch, except the watch-face is replaced with a print. This golden floral print stands out elegantly, adding some welcome warmth to the all black color scheme. The aesthetics of bog oak, which takes thousands of years to mature, hint at the balance of endurance and change in the face of passing time. This concept is contrasted with a warm and inviting golden floral print that can be seen to symbolize nature. Skillfully crafted, this bracelet is a stunning contemporary piece that is minimalist, creative and unique.</p>

Being larger in size, the ring stands out with a flare of natural colors and unique tactile feel, as well as a unique patch of unpolished antler texture on the upper of the ring.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Antlers are extensions of the skull, seasonally grown and shed by members of the deer family. Antlers are true bone that grows symmetrically in pairs and are mostly attributable to males. The growth of these unique structures places a considerable nutritional strain on the body of a deer. The size of antlers speaks of a deer&#8217;s ability to navigate and find enough food in its environment. Since the prehistoric times antlers were used to make tools, weapons and jewelry. Some antlers have unique properties, as is the case with moose antlers that greatly aid a moose&#8217;s hearing. Antlers are well known for their use by Magdalenian culture in European Late Paleolithic. From this culture, modern museums inherited a number of beautifully carved and engraved pieces of prehistoric art, including this &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison_Licking_Insect_Bite" target="_blank">Bison Licking Insect Bite</a>&#8216; spear-thrower fragment created sometime between 10,000 &#8211; 18,000 BC.</p>
<h4>About WooDoo</h4>
<p>WooDoo is an extraordinary, magnetic, and minimalist jewelry brand. WooDoo is about creative exploration of space and its geometric properties. WooDoo&#8217;s quest is an inquiry into the possibilities of tangible expression of this visionary aesthetic. This brand&#8217;s jewelry transcends the realm of physical, bridging the tangible and the creative.</p>
<p>WooDoo pieces are majestic and truly memorable, while being handcrafted from a number of select precious woods, including African Blackwood, Bog Oak or Purpleheart Wood. Each of the brand&#8217;s pieces is an original and unique experience of jewelry aesthetic. It is this aesthetic, along with skillful execution that WooDoo&#8217;s accessories owe to the duo of creative designers standing behind this visionary brand.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>These wonderful earrings were recreated by WooDoo on our special request in extremely rare and valuable African Blackwood. This request was made specifically to complement WooDoo's casual <a href="http://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-deer-antler-ring-polished-w10" target="_blank">Deer Antler W10</a> ring. The earrings are complete with delicate and graceful silver pins. Fluent, unique and minimalist, these earrings have a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<p>Engineered Stone is a material that considerably improves upon the properties of natural stone. Engineered stone was invented in Italy in early 1980s by Marcello Toncelli, founder of world-renowned Breton S.P.A. This type of stone is tailor-made with a mix of stone/marble powder, low-viscosity/high-strength epoxy or resin, a supplement of coloring, stabilizers and UV absorbing additives. To complement stone/marble powder aggregates, materials like colored glass or metal flakes can be added. Depending on the composition of stone powders and their intended application, there exist two major types of engineered stone - marble and quartz.</p>

<p>Engineered stone is mainly worked with a water jet cutter or a diamond blade. It is less porous, exhibiting a uniform structure without any hidden internal cracks or flaws. The binding resin allows for some flexibility, preventing engineered stone from cracking. This property decreases over time, as resins continue to harden during a product&#8217;s lifetime. It is worth noting that engineered stone is not completely UV stable, so a very long exposure to UV light might result in color changes and breakdown of the epoxy or resin binding agents.</p>
