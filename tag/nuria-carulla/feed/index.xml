<div>Nuria Carulla is a truly spectacular and outstanding jeweler hailing from Colombia. Nuria&#8217;s unique vision and her extensive experience translate into amazing works of jewelry art. The unique thing about this art is that it feels timeless, just as much as it feels contemporary. We don&#8217;t want to say a whole lot about Nuria Carulla and her outstanding, absolutely incredible work. Really, the language of her jewelry pieces is much more universal. Let us just mention some of the most essential and the most interesting facts and tell-tale stories.</div>

<h4>Personal Background and Professional Education</h4>
<div>Nuria Carulla was born in Bogota, Colombia in 1951. Her family is originally from Barcelona, Spain, but had to move to Colombia for political reasons, as both her grandfather and her father, being Catalan, took active part in the independence movement. Nuria&#8217;s first visit to her homeland, Barcelona, Spain took place when she was 15. This trip was inspired by her grandfather who insisted that they take a boat in order for the family to see the magnitude of a distance between Bogota, Colombia&#8217;s capital, and Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, a region located in northeastern Spain. Upon arrival, Nuria was absolutely surprised to discover that Catalan is not the language that is almost elusively used within her family, but is instead widely spoken. It is here in Barcelona that Nuria Carulla undertakes her first studies in jewelry craft at the Massana School (1966-1970). Gemology studies at the Geological and Mining Institute of Spain ensue (1968-1970), along with mastering engraving at the University of Los Andes, Bogota (1971-1972).</div>

<h4>Participation in Jewelry Workshops and Personal Views</h4>
<div>Nuria Carulla is an influential figure in Colombian jewelry and art, having among others, curated a program aimed at helping Colombian artisans reach international markets through numerous practical workshops around the country. In her interviews, Nuria Carulla loves to reiterate that jewelry is a lot like a communication gesture by which we get to say who are, what we think and what we like. Despite her professional accomplishments, Nuria Carulla remains humble and says that we shouldn&#8217;t believe ourselves to have all of the wisdom, but instead we should work together and learning from each other. What an inspirational figure!</div>
