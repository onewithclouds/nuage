<p>Designer of exclusive contemporary jewelry extraordinaire, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jennifer.j.park.31" target="_blank">Jennifer Jordan Park</a>, is a true talent/mastermind behind the tasteful and exquisite Wear Ever Jewelry brand. The flowing, wavy lines of the brand&#8217;s designs add to an organic-like experience of her jewelry pieces. Such is the case with the incredible turquoise and royal blue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basse-taille" target="_blank">basse-taille</a> enamel necklace pictured above. The enamel pieces of the necklace are complemented with lapis and emerald gemstones. In line with Wear Ever Jewelry aesthetic, the base of the enamel is carefully prepared, while the silver the pieces are set in is brought to a beautiful contrasting finish, which in this case is matte. <span id="more-595"></span></p>
<h4>Contemporary Amuletic Jewelry Design and Inspiration</h4>
<p>Interestingly, many items are intended by Jennifer as spiritual objects and amulets, aiming to comfort the wearer. Deeply fascinated by amuletic jewelry, Jeniffer kindly told us that many jewelry pieces can be considered protective or amuletic, if you truly believe that something about it protects You. Protective properties can be attributed to shape, color or content of a jewelry item. Pictured below, the &#8216;Chrisalis&#8217; necklace is one of Wear Ever Jewelry&#8217;s most prominent amuletic jewelry pieces. In the words of Jennifer Park, herself: &#8220;The necklace depicts the chrysalis of the butterfly, which is a protective structure during that period of change from caterpillar to butterfly.&#8221; As to the inspiration behind these beautiful pieces, Jennifer adds: &#8220;a lot of nature&#8217;s creations, from gemstones to insects, make me think about how they can function as protective amulets.&#8221;</p>

<h4>Educational Background and Professional Preferences</h4>
<p>Jennifer Park received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Tennessee. Before conceiving Wear Ever Jewelry, Jennifer worked as a graphic print designer for about 20 years. Naturally, Jennifer also holds a Master of Arts Degree in studio art, namely jewelry and metals. Overall, Wear Ever Jewelry has been Jennifer&#8217;s predominant occupation for over 15 years . Having worked in the Middle East, Wear Ever Jewelry&#8217;s Jennifer Park developed a keen appreciation for gold and silver, which is why almost all of her designs are now exclusively set in sterling silver, as well as 18k or 22k gold. This can be seen in the magnificent &#8216;Chrysalis&#8217; cloisonne enamel necklace above. Speaking of cloisonne jewelry, Jennifer is fascinated with traditional methods, which, among others, include enamel and granulation. All of this truly shows in her unconventional, yet beautiful, artistic and contemporary designs.</p>

<p>Through Jennifer Park&#8217;s vision, experience and a refined taste, Wear Ever Jewelry creations are without a doubt unique pieces of handmade personal adornment. Each piece is made from gold, silver and gemstones. With these lasting materials, Wear Ever Jewelry items are created to be enjoyed for many years to come.
