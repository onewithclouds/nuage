		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>An ellegant branch is a poetic ode to spring, purity and vitality...</em></p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. When it comes to interpreting the symbolism of a branch, one of the most common is a reference to an olive branch. An olive branch is a notable symbol of peace, purity and good will. The symbol originates from the Arab folk transition, but is most notable in the customs of Ancient Greece. An olive branch is, in fact, present in almost every culture of the Mediterranean basin. In Ancient Greece, olive branches and wreaths were often worn by brides. A dove carrying an olive branch is a prominent symbol of peace in early Christian art. As such, an olive branch has firmly established itself as a widely recognized symbol by the XVIII century.</p>
<p>Dimensions : 36 x 10 x 0.4 mm<br />
Adjustable chain : 40-46 cm<br />
Material : Stainless Steel<br />
Color : Black</p>

<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>
<p>The meaningful design concepts behind the visionary contemporary accessories brand Moorigin can be interpreted as inspired by nature, simple and sensual. Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design. Inspired by our planet&#8217;s living environment, the brand embraces some of nature&#8217;s most intricate and enduring forces, such as evolution and structured, orderly chaos. Stemming from a personal vision, unobstructed and uncluttered, Moorigin accessories feel personal, evoking a feeling of atmosphere and sensuality.</p>

<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. The ripple effect may often be referred to as a heartbeat to eternity. The symbolism behind it is often based around the understanding that we are all interconnected. For instance, thoughts and actions can be associated with stones dropped into a lake, creating outward traveling ripples. These ripples, in turn, affect other people's lives, while their reactions - our own. This pattern has been successfully applied to the scientific studies of computer science, economics and social interaction. The intricate message of this symbolic construct is that each of us, even if in the smallest of ways, has an innate capacity to change the world.</p>

<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>
<p>The meaningful design concepts behind the visionary contemporary accessories brand Moorigin can be interpreted as inspired by nature, simple and sensual. Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design. Inspired by our planet&#8217;s living environment, the brand embraces some of nature&#8217;s most intricate and enduring forces, such as evolution and structured, orderly chaos. Stemming from a personal vision, unobstructed and uncluttered, Moorigin accessories feel personal, evoking a feeling of atmosphere and sensuality.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Translucent body of a thin bamboo is gracefully standing between Heaven and Earth. A light fragrance is carried with the wind, creating a gentle disturbance...</em></p>
<p>Sasa is a word of Japanese origin (【笹】, ささ), denoting beautiful ground-cover bamboo that grows to about 1m in height. A distinct feature of Sasa bamboo is the fact that each of its tender branches will develop only one gracious leaf. Sasa leaves are the inspiration behind the design of this beautiful accessory. Also, Sasa will flower only once in 20 years.</p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. As such, leaves symbolize hope, revival and renewal, representing potency and growth. According to the Chinese tradition, leaves also stand for all of the beings in the universe, hence can be seen as exemplifying people.</p>
<p>Dimensions : 8 x 31 x 0.3 mm<br />
Adjustable chain : 40 - 46 cm<br />
Material : Stainless Steel<br />
Color : Silver</p>

<p>Bamboo is a symbol of regeneration, renewal, freedom of spirit and flexibility. It is also the fastest vertically growing plant on the planet with an ability to reach full height in one season. Bamboo&#8217;s growth, although remarkable, is always gradual and incremental and is reminiscent of personal continuous improvement and commitment to learning.  Also, bamboo plants might not always look to be as tough as other trees in the forest. Yet, they endure the coldest of winters, hot summers and usually are the only ones standing in the aftermath of a storm. As such, bamboo sends a powerful message that can be summarized in the common wisdom of &#8216;bend, but do not break&#8217;. A message that speaks of a more sophisticated, gentle strength. A strength that does not fight the circumstances, but through flexibility remains standing tall.</p>
