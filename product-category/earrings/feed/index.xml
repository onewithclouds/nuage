		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Fleeting bubbles invite one to appreciate the beauty of the present moment...</em></p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. Bubbles are such an incredible symbol with their meaning spanning notions from childish and cheerful to philosophical and spiritual. A metaphor for life, delicate bubbles taking shape can mean something magical, fleeting and fragile. Every time a bubble breaks, we strive to create a new, larger and longer lasting one. It is this determination that we should also apply to our dreams and life goals. Bubbles provide rare moments of magic, letting us realize that we have the power to create and improve upon our creations. Their existence reminds us to appreciate the beauty and grace of the present moment. Bubbles also symbolize childhood innocence and fun, possibly giving us a chance to lose some of our cares and worries for moment. Let the symbolism of the bubbles inspire you to develop a prominent appreciation of life and live it to the fullest!</p>
<p>Dimensions : 15x16x0.4mm<br />

<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>
<p>The meaningful design concepts behind the visionary contemporary accessories brand Moorigin can be interpreted as inspired by nature, simple and sensual. Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design. Inspired by our planet&#8217;s living environment, the brand embraces some of nature&#8217;s most intricate and enduring forces, such as evolution and structured, orderly chaos. Stemming from a personal vision, unobstructed and uncluttered, Moorigin accessories feel personal, evoking a feeling of atmosphere and sensuality.</p>

<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. As such, beautiful, crystals often capture our full attention. Their orderly, complex crystalline structure often stirs our imagination as to how these unusual, captivating treasures were created. Due to their clarity and scarcity crystals are often taken to symbolize purity. In the Middle Ages they  have been a reminder of the ultimate components of life: Earth, Wind, Fire and Water. Crystals have always been associated with spirituality. As such they were often assigned magical attributes and healing power.</p>

<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. The ripple effect may often be referred to as a heartbeat to eternity. The symbolism behind it is often based around the understanding that we are all interconnected. For instance, thoughts and actions can be associated with stones dropped into a lake, creating outward traveling ripples. These ripples, in turn, affect other people's lives, while their reactions - our own. This pattern has been successfully applied to the scientific studies of computer science, economics and social interaction. The intricate message of this symbolic construct is that each of us, even if in the smallest of ways, has an innate capacity to change the world.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Translucent body of a thin bamboo is gracefully standing between Heaven and Earth. A light fragrance is carried with the wind, creating a gentle disturbance...</em></p>
<p>Sasa is a word of Japanese origin (【笹】, ささ), denoting beautiful ground-cover bamboo that grows to about 1m in height. A distinct feature of Sasa bamboo is the fact that each of its tender branches will develop only one gracious leaf. Sasa leaves are the inspiration behind the design of this beautiful accessory. Also, Sasa will flower only once in 20 years.</p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. As such, leaves symbolize hope, revival and renewal, representing potency and growth. According to the Chinese tradition, leaves also stand for all of the beings in the universe, hence can be seen as exemplifying people.</p>

<p>Bamboo is a symbol of regeneration, renewal, freedom of spirit and flexibility. It is also the fastest vertically growing plant on the planet with an ability to reach full height in one season. Bamboo&#8217;s growth, although remarkable, is always gradual and incremental and is reminiscent of personal continuous improvement and commitment to learning.  Also, bamboo plants might not always look to be as tough as other trees in the forest. Yet, they endure the coldest of winters, hot summers and usually are the only ones standing in the aftermath of a storm. As such, bamboo sends a powerful message that can be summarized in the common wisdom of &#8216;bend, but do not break&#8217;. A message that speaks of a more sophisticated, gentle strength. A strength that does not fight the circumstances, but through flexibility remains standing tall.</p>

<p>Sasa is a word of Japanese origin (【笹】, ささ), denoting beautiful ground-cover bamboo that grows to about 1m in height. A distinct feature of Sasa bamboo is the fact that each of its tender branches will develop only one gracious leaf. Sasa leaves are the inspiration behind the design of this beautiful accessory. Also, Sasa will flower only once in 20 years.</p>
<p>Moorigin accessories, through their minimalist and essential nature, lend themselves well to symbolic interpretation. As such, leaves symbolize hope, revival and renewal, representing potency and growth. According to the Chinese tradition, leaves also stand for all of the beings in the universe, hence can be seen as exemplifying people.</p>
<p>Bamboo is a symbol of regeneration, renewal, freedom of spirit and flexibility. It is also the fastest vertically growing plant on the planet with an ability to reach full height in one season. Bamboo&#8217;s growth, although remarkable, is always gradual and incremental and is reminiscent of personal continuous improvement and commitment to learning.  Also, bamboo plants might not always look to be as tough as other trees in the forest. Yet, they endure the coldest of winters, hot summers and usually are the only ones standing in the aftermath of a storm. As such, bamboo sends a powerful message that can be summarized in the common wisdom of &#8216;bend, but do not break&#8217;. A message that speaks of a more sophisticated, gentle strength. A strength that does not fight the circumstances, but through flexibility remains standing tall.</p>
<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Moorigin accessories are quite comfortable and atmospheric, partly because of their low weight. Although, being lightweight these can bend, despite the fact they&#8217;re made of steel. Please keep this in mind, to prevent bending your lovely Moorigin accessories. Also, make sure to remove them while bathing, taking shower or swimming, as even stainless steel can be prone to some forms of corrosion when exposed to water or humidity. In the event, your accessories do come in contact with water, simply clean them with a soft cloth.</p>
<h4>About Moorigin</h4>
<p>The meaningful design concepts behind the visionary contemporary accessories brand Moorigin can be interpreted as inspired by nature, simple and sensual. Moorigin accessories are developed around bare essentials. These essentials include only the material and the design. Inspired by our planet&#8217;s living environment, the brand embraces some of nature&#8217;s most intricate and enduring forces, such as evolution and structured, orderly chaos. Stemming from a personal vision, unobstructed and uncluttered, Moorigin accessories feel personal, evoking a feeling of atmosphere and sensuality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These wonderful earrings were recreated by WooDoo on our special request in extremely rare and valuable African Blackwood. This request was made specifically to complement WooDoo&#8217;s magnificent <a href="https://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-african-blackwood-ring-w07" target="_blank">African Blackwood W07</a> and <a href="https://onewithclouds.github.io/nuage/product/woodoo-african-blackwood-ring-polyhedral-w08" target="_blank">W08</a> rings. The earrings are complete with delicate and graceful silver pins. Fluent, unique and minimalist, these earrings have a sense of presence and style that is easily recognizable and truly memorable.</p>
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>African Blackwood is a very rare and expensive wood, exhibiting moisture repellent qualities, as well as incredible dimensional stability. This precious wood is highly valued since the ancient times, when its primary usage purposes included furniture and musical instruments. Considered the original ebony thousand of years ago, this wood was imported to and processed in Ancient Egypt. The name &#8220;ebony&#8217; is actually derived from Egyptian &#8220;hbny&#8221;, while other names for this wood include babanus, grenadilla and mpingo. The African Blackwood tree itself takes about 60 years to mature and originates from seasonally dry regions of Senegal, as well as similar regions east to Eritrea and south to Transvaal.</p>
<p>African Blackwood is a lustrous wood that is one of the hardest and densest in the world.  The color hue of African Blackwood ranges from reddish dark brown and purple to pure black. This timber exhibits little or no straight grain and has an even texture. Extremely durable in terms of resistance to decay, African Blackwood is also moderately resistant to insect attacks. While beautiful and durable, this precious wood is notorious for its blunting effect on wood cutters, making it very difficult to work with either by hand or with machine tools. Although pretty much indiscernible upon completion, African Blackwood has a mild distinctive scent that it emits while being processed. Among many precious woods, African Blackwood is considered one of the very finest timbers to be used in producing turned wood objects.</p>
<h4>About WooDoo</h4>
<p>WooDoo is an incredibly magentic contemporary jewelry brand unlike any other. WooDoo is concerned with creative exploration of space, its geometric properties, as well as the possibilities of their tangible expression. All of this combines into a very original and unique aesthetic. WooDoo&#8217;s works are true artistic explorations of the properties of space. These explorations stem from visions of space that get translated into the physical world by means of minimalist tangible objects. But even after receiving physical form, WooDoo&#8217;s jewelry pieces feel deeply rooted in the realm of creative and visionary.</p>
<p>WooDoo&#8217;s accessories are truly memorable, commanding attention and recognition and are handcrafted from a number of select tactile precious woods, like African Blackwood or Purpleheart Wood. Each of WooDoo&#8217;s jewelry pieces carries an unmistakably modern, contemporary jewelry aesthetic. It is this aesthetic, along with skillful execution that WooDoo&#8217;s accessories owe to the duo of creative designers, standing behind this unique and visionary brand.</p>
