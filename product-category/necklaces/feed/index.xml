<p>Mother of Pearl (Nacre) has been used in jewelry for thousands of years, with the earliest known pieces attributable to ancient Egyptians and Sumerians. East Asian and Islamic art has also used nacre for beautiful inlay work. Mother of Pearl has become extremely popular in Europe during the Victorian Era. This organic gemstone belongs to a small group that includes coral, amber, jet, ivory and, of course, pearl. Mother of Pearl is often thought of as encouraging prosperity, offering motherly and soothing protection, while promoting intuition and imagination.</p>
<p>Howlite is considered to be a stone of calm and tranquility. A stone that can calm and soothe the emotions, help cope with an overactive mind and achieve a deep and restful sleep.

<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Since the ancient times coral is a traditional gift of protection for the expectant mother or a newborn child. Coral is also associated with emotional healing. Blue coral in particular is believed to have an ability of reconnecting oneself to one&#8217;s inner child, providing stability, reducing fear and finding inner peace. Coral is also believed to extend its protection to anyone living, traveling or working by/in the sea. Since coral is of organic origin, it is often thought of as an aid in rekindling one&#8217;s relationship with nature and its wonders, stimulating creativity and optimism, as well as enabling it&#8217;s bearer to enjoy life to the fullest. It may be the reason why, all around the world, coral has been used as jewelry for at least thousands of years.</p>
<p>Howlite is considered to be a stone of calm and tranquility. A stone that can calm and soothe the emotions, help cope with an overactive mind and achieve a deep and restful sleep. Howlite is believed to reduce conflicts, facilitate communication, promote kindness, compassion and peaceful coexistence.  This truly beautiful and tranquil gem is believed to aid in clarifying one’s mind to develop a more prominent awareness of one’s ambitions and goals. Often referred to as an ‘attunement stone’, Howlite is thought to help expand the horizons and open the mind to wisdom and new knowledge.</p>

<h4>Materials</h4>
<p>Pyrite is a stunning mineral that bears incredible resemblance to gold. The fire is often sad to be hidden with its gleaming beauty. Pyrite is a stone that is brought to life by striking it against another stone or metal, producing plentiful sparks. Hence this mineral is often appearing as a stone of action vitality and will. A stone that taps into a person&#8217;s abilities and potential. This beautiful stone is believed to bring confidence and persistence to carry things to completion. A stone with a strong connection to Earth element, it closely resonates with Fire as well, providing for a symbolic connection between the two. Pyrite is often thought of as reminiscent of the warmth and lasting presence of the sun, as well as the ability to generate desirable outcomes by one&#8217;s own power.</p>
<p>Hematite is one of the prettiest and most unique crystals used in jewelry accessories. This crystal provides a unique combination of shiny charisma, while retaining the ability to remain reserved. It is one of the few magnetic crystals the structure of which is dominated by iron. Hematite is often referred to as a &#8216;seeker crystal&#8217; that helps one find a new path or approach to gain something you desire, but not yet posses. Hematite crystals are thought to have great grounding and balancing effect, as well as serving to stimulate mind, memory, sometimes evoking deep thought.</p>
<p>Lava rock, volcanic rock or basalt is a beautiful matte black stone with an incredible texture. It is believed to be an excellent grounding stone, strengthening one&#8217;s connection to Mother Earth and providing stability in the time of change. Lava rock is also often thought of as a physical embodiment of fire, being a stone that started as fiery molten lava, subsequently turning into rock.</p>
